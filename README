mc_barf
=======
Intel Microcode Dumper
This tool takes as input a binary version of an Intel Microcode update file and
spews out the header information regarding all updates in the binary. The data
can be displayed as well.

Most Intel microcode files are ascii.  I have included an ascii to binary
converter, "mc_dat_to_bin.py" which also ignores the comments.  The resulting
file will be the same name as in the input file but ending with a '.bin'
extension.

Sources/References
==================
[1] The format is that as specified in:
Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual
Volume 3A: System Programming Guide, Part 1
Of interest is section 8.11.

[2] The Intel pieces in the Linux kernel:
linux/arch/x86/kernel/microcode_{core, intel}.c
linux/arch/x86/include/asm/microcode.h

These permit the kernel to initiate a CPU microcode update are also helpful.
Source kernel used in writing mc_barf was linux-3.8.4

Caveat
======
This is super ultra alpha.
I have not fully tested or validated everything.
